- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichalKoder
- 👀 I’m interested in web apps development
- From time to time I love to `unwind` doing some CRUD-less small apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning e-commerce online store platforms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some original and useful app...
- 📫 Sometimes I 🏃 but also can 🚶 so if you want to talk just PM me on Git.
